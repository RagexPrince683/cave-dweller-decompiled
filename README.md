# :pick: Cave Dweller (cavenoise)

This repository contains a decompilation of the "Cave Dweller" Minecraft mod by [Gargin](https://www.youtube.com/@Gargin).
It should remain functionally equivalent to the source code as to provide a foundational point for forks, ports, and backports.

Both this and the source are licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit).

**Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Gargin in any way.**

## Mappings

This project uses the [Parchment](https://parchmentmc.org) mappings rather than standard Mojang mappings (Mojmap).
While Mojmap only provides field, method, and class names, Parchment also adds documentation and parameter names on top of Mojmap.

Forge provides a word of caution when using unofficial mappings as they may sometimes not work. If you wish not to use Parchment mappings, you can revert to standard Mojmap via the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.19.3'
```

Considerations:

- Parchment is usually one version behind Mojang mappings; however, it is possible to use earlier versions of Parchment with newer versions of Minecraft.
- Mojang mappings do not exist prior to 1.14. You will want to use MCP mappings at that point.
- MCP mappings do not exist past 1.17. If possible, you should use Mojang/Parchment mappings anyway as they are more complete than those provided by MCP.
- Yarn, the mappings used by Fabric, are less restrictive than alternatives. The caveat is that you *will* have more trouble finding support online.

Usage of Mojang mappings must additionally adhere to this license:

```

You may copy and use the mappings for development purposes, but you may not redistribute the mappings complete and unmodified.

## Contributing

I will not accept contributions for code that changes the behaviour (including bug fixes), metadata, or signatures of the mod.
Please contribute these changes to a fork, either yours or someone else's.
